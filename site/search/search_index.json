We've built it mainly for security researchers and bug bounty hunters, allowing them to run internet scanning tools such as nmap, masscan, massdns and get results very quickly. However, thank to its design, you can use Fleex to run any command you need to distribute. Supported providers We currently support the following providers: Linode Digitalocean Note that in the future we will add more of them, but for now you should be good with these two as they are the most common ones. Installation Fleex is written in Go, so you can easily install it with the following command: GO111MODULE=on go get -v github.com/sw33tLie/fleex Don't forget to set the GOPATH environment variable if you want to run fleex from any folder. Initial setup Fleex needs some configuration files to be downloaded on your local machine. To get them, run the following command just after you've installed it: fleex config init This will fetch the configuration files from our GitHub release and put them in your ~/fleex/ folder. The only file you need to worry about is ~/fleex/config.yaml : open it with your favourite text editor, it will look like this: provider: digitalocean or linode public-ssh-file: id_rsa.pub private-ssh-file: id_rsa linode: token: YOUR_LINODE_TOKEN region: eu-central size: g6-nanode-1 image: private/12345678 : put your image id here (./fleex images to get it) port: 2266 username: op password: USER_PASSWORD digitalocean: token: YOUR_DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN region: fra1 size: s-1vcpu-1gb image: 12345678 # put your image id here port: 2266 username: op password: USER_PASSWORD tags: - vps - fleex You only need to manually edit a few words here. First thing first, choose the provider you want to use by default and manually edit the provider: line accordingly. Then get your cloud provider's token from their website and put it by either replacing YOUR_LINODE_TOKEN or YOUR_DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN . After that, save the edits to the file. Now you need to figure out if you already have an image on your cloud provider. An image is basically a backup of an old VPS, which might have custom tools installed. To avoid installing the same tools over and over, we recommend spawning new Fleex boxes using a custom image, rather than a default Ubuntu image. If you already have an image, just run fleex images to get a list of images, then get the image ID for the image you want to use and put it in the configuration file. If you don't, you need to build a new image. Building an image Fleex takes care of creating a new image if you need one. It will install tools that are usually needed by infosec researchers/bug bounty hunters. If you want to edit the tools that will be installed, manually edit the ~/fleex/build/common.yaml file before proceeding. Now, to actually start the building process, simply run: fleex build This will take some time, around 20 minutes on average. The good news is that you will only have to do this once for every cloud provider you wish to use. When it's done, run fleex images , get the image id and manually put it into the configuration file, then save it. Spawning new boxes Once you have configured everything, the real fun begins. To spawn a new fleet (aka, many boxes with starting with fleetname-box_id) run: fleex spawn -n FLEET_NAME -c FLEET_COUNT Remember that for any fleex subcommand, you can use the -h flag to get help regarding its usage. Fleex will automatically wait until all boxes are ready before exiting. Running distributed commands When your fleet is ready, you can finally run distributed commands. We will start with an example command: fleex scan -n pwn -i /tmp/test-input -o scan-results.txt -c \"sudo /usr/bin/massdns -r /home/op/lists/resolvers.txt -t A -o S {{INPUT}} -w {{OUTPUT}}\" This will send the sudo /usr/bin/massdns -r /home/op/lists/resolvers.txt -t A -o S {{INPUT}} -w {{OUTPUT}} command to all the boxes of your pwn fleet. Note that those {{INPUT}} and {{OUTPUT}} are special labels that gets adjusted accordingly for each box. Fleex will split the input file, in this case /tmp/test-input and send a chunk to each box. Once every box has finished, all output files will be downloaded to your local machine and merged automatically: the final output will be the scan-results.txt file, the name passed to the -o flag.","title":"index"},{"location":"#welcome-to-fleex-docs","text":"Fleex allows you to spawn multiple VPS on various cloud providers and later use them to run distributed commands.
